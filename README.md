# BaboOS

This repository contains the code for our robotics team INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition season.

### Helpful Crap

built using Java<br>
Android Studio 2024.1.2 Koala + Java 21<br>
main class at `TeamCode/src/main/java/com.technodot.ftc.twentyfour/BaboOS.java`<br>
i hope i didn't mess up renaming the package name because lets be honest, the old one was not sigmatical at all

### People

- **@technodot** the programmer with the uncommon lack of common sense (just plain stupid and special)
- **@akwatson** the builder/thinker and has w builing rizz but plays too much tarkov
- **gavvy lasky** the builder/thinker and has w rizz but no discord :(
- **@silentrunner101** the designer/thinker who never asked someone out and lacks in rizz overall
- **@safire1k** the builder/thinker who makes sure the nuisances dont blow anything up
- **@somethin_999** the builder/thinker who is also ~~secretly~~ an irish redhead named mack
- **max meirowski** the muscle for intimidating the other team with nonverbal threats
- **@averyisbest65** the utterly useless nusiance
  - MODS, BAN HIM
    - AND BLOW UP HIS HOUSE *a joke*

(please, have mercy)<br>
(i missed like the first week of robotics so I have no clue how to build crap)
