# BaboOS

This repository contains the code for our robotics team INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition season.

### Helpful Crap

built using Java<br>
Android Studio 2024.1.2 Koala + Java 21<br>
main class at `TeamCode/src/main/java/com.technodot.ftc.twentyfour/BaboOS.java`<br>
i hope i didn't mess up renaming the package name because lets be honest, the old one was not sigmatical at all
